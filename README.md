## A stroke is a medical consition where there is a blockage in the blood supplement to the brain, or when a brain vessel burst. Many factors regarding one's lifestyle and health contribute to increasing or decreasing the chances of getting a stroke. Some of those factors have greater wieght and effect than others, and it is our objective in this project to train a model to predict the chances of having a stroke as these parameters differ from case to case.


### Note: a detailed walkthrough of the code could be found in the code's notebook "main.ipynb" provided in the reposetry. 

 1. The libraries used in the code of the model are: numpy, pandas, altair, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, gradio, plotly, and matplotlib. All can be installed by uncommenting the first cell in the notebook main.ipynb and running it
```
! pip install numpy pandas altair seaborn scikit-learn xgboost gradio plotly matplotlib
```
