## A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. Stroke prediction is the process of identifying individuals who are at risk of having a stroke. It is essential to anticipate the onset of a stroke by utilizing machine learning techniques
---------------------
In this model we used two databases which  used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.


## libraries

We used:-

pandas library to read the data

seaborn, altair, plotly, xgboost and pyplot for Visualization

scikit-learn for prediction

And we have added a code inside the model to install these libraries in case you did not install it before.

## how to use the model

You can run the model to see the
