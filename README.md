## A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. Stroke prediction is the process of identifying individuals who are at risk of having a stroke. It is essential to anticipate the onset of a stroke by utilizing machine learning techniques
---------------------
In this model we used two databases which  used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.


## libraries

We used:-

pandas library to read the data

seaborn, altair, plotly, xgboost and pyplot for Visualization

scikit-learn for prediction

And we have added a code inside the model to install these libraries in case you did not install it before.

## how to use the model

You can run the model to see the result of our data that we upload

or you can run the model with your oun data, by uploading your data and read it in this cell
